# Sequential Recommender Systems 
This is a repository for our project about Sequential Recommender Systems as part of the Information Retrieval course at Radboud University, 2022. 

The dataset we used can be downloaded via GitHub through [this link](https://github.com/eifuentes/lastfm-dataset-1K/releases/download/v1.0/lastfm-dataset-1k.snappy.parquet). It is a dataset based off of Last.FM.
Each notebook (.ipynb) file reads it locally, meaning it must be located at the same file level as them when reading data.

This work was mostly based off of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14233) (Next Basket Recommandation Reality Check by Li et al., 2021)
